# WeVibe Spotify - Enhanced with Images & Algorithms

This project has been enhanced with two major feature sets:

## üñºÔ∏è Playlist Image Upload Feature

### What's New
- **Custom Playlist Cover Images**: Users can now upload custom images when creating new playlists
- **Image Preview**: Real-time preview of uploaded images before playlist creation
- **Drag & Drop UI**: Intuitive interface for image selection and management
- **Spotify API Integration**: Automatically uploads images to Spotify using their playlist image API

### How It Works
1. Navigate to the Playlist section
2. Click "Create New Playlist"
3. Upload an image by clicking the image area or "Upload Image" button
4. Fill in playlist name and description
5. Create playlist - the image will be automatically uploaded to Spotify

### Technical Implementation
- Base64 image conversion for Spotify API compatibility
- File validation and preview functionality
- Seamless integration with existing playlist creation workflow

## üßÆ Comprehensive Algorithms & Hashing Library

### Algorithms Module (`src/utils/algorithms.js`)

#### Sorting Algorithms
- **Quick Sort**: O(n log n) average case, divide and conquer
- **Merge Sort**: O(n log n) stable sorting algorithm

- **FNV-1a Hash**: General-purpose hash function
- **SDBM Hash**: Simple and effective hash function
- **Lose Lose Hash**: Educational example (poor distribution)

#### Cryptographic-Style Hashes
- **Simple SHA-256**: SHA-256 inspired hash function
- **Simple MD5**: MD5 inspired hash function
- **CRC32**: Cyclic redundancy check for error detection

#### Advanced Data Structures
- **Consistent Hashing**: For distributed systems and load balancing
- **Bloom Filter**: Probabilistic set membership testing
- **Hash Table**: Custom implementation with collision resolution
- **Password Hashing**: Secure password storage with salt

#### Utility Functions
- Hash distribution quality testing
- Performance comparison tools
- Checksum utilities
- Test data generation
